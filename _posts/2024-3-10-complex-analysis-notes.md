From this day forward, I'll be reading the book $\textit{Complex Analysis (Princeton Lectures in Analysis, No. 2)}$ for at least 1 hour
per day until I finish the book. I'll put anything I thought interesting/important on this page.

Ch1 \\
A $\textbf{holomorphic}$ function (defined to be a function with a first derivative) is infinitely many times complex differentiable.
i.e. the existence of the first derivative will guarantee the existence of derivatives of any order.

$\textbf{Cauchy-Riemann}$ equations: 
$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \ and
 \ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$ (equivalent to $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}} = 0$)\\
$f = u + iv$, f is complex differentiable at a complex point iff(if and only if) the partials of u and v satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations at that point.

A function that is $\textbf{analytic}$ i.e. has a power series expansion at every point on $\Omega$ is also holomorphic here. The reverse is also true.
